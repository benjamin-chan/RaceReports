This was my Facebook post from a few days before the 2014 race:

> 6 days until redemption from my most awful beat down. Hopefully I won't do anything stupid... like forgetting my shoes, or falling down and injuring my hand the week before, or not checking the battery on my Suunto the night before, or misreading the course map that was tacked up on my wall for months and not realizing we went through an aid station twice and thus underestimating the time it would take me to get to my drop bag leading to a huge psychological letdown.

My finish time for the 2013 race was 15:41:28. So many things went wrong that even with the mental/psychological beating, I immediately signed up for the 2014 race soon after registration opened up.

However, I didn't quite have the race I wanted to have in 2014.

My *B* goal was modest; simply to beat my 2013 time. My *A* goal was to smash it, by like 1:30:00 or even 2:00:00. I knew I needed to do a few things differently than in 2013:

1. Go slow, especially in the first half.
2. Don't freak out about the long climb at the 40K mark; save some stuff for the climbs after that.

Despite a seemingly tougher section from AS1 to AS2 compared to 2013 (dictated by a course change), I felt great all the way through to Quest University (AS5). I was slower than in 2013 by about 30 minutes, but the day's mantra was *slow and steady*. I rolled into Quest after about 9:20 on the course, but feeling good enough to joke to spectators about climbing up some stairs to the aid station instead of a nice gradual, smooth path (pretty exemplary of this course; of all the paths from point A to B, Gary Robbins, the race director, will opt include the toughest in his race).

I knew the section immedately after Quest to AS6 would be the big test. This is where I psychologically lost it in 2013. That year, it took me 3 hours to cover that 9K and I resigned myself to dropping when I finally got to AS6 but kept going after an aid station volunteer said I had plenty of time to beat the 16-hour cutoff. This year, I rolled into AS6 a full hour ahead of last year's split. And I felt if I got here in good mental shape, I could still take more time off from last year. However, just ahead of AS6, I got a bit excited nearing the end of this test, forgot the mantra, ran a smooth downhill section too aggressively, and trashed my quads. I didn't realize just how badly until I left the aid station. I couldn't muster anything faster than a power hike except on the very few smooth and flat sections for the next 11-12 miles. The downs were harder to take than the ups. Pretty disheartening. But, hey, no guts, no glory. I was doing a lot of walking. But when I was power hiking, I was power hiking well. I passed more people than passed me.

I came into the finish at 15:14:32. So I met my *B* goal, didn't met my *A* goal. And I've drastically cut down the time from finish to wanting to sign up for next year's race from weeks to hours. Unlike last year, I'm also pretty sure I'm not going to have post-traumatic nightmares about the course. Also, for the hours after the race, I felt really physically beat down. So much so that I asked Cat if I seemed as beat down last year. She told me last year I was elated right after the finish but that I was definitely more beat down this year. I'm taking that as a net positive; that I left more out on the course this time around. That I only have 1 thing to fix for next year is another net positive.
