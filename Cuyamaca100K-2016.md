Cuyamaca 100K was a late addition to my 2016 race calendar. For some reason, I
really wanted a Western States lottery ticket and Cuyamaca mostly fit my
schedule and was logistically simple. I say "mostly" because it was 4 weeks
after my "A" race, The Rut 28K. So Cuyamaca replaced The Rut as my "A" race
for the year and The Rut became my "B" race. Training for both was going to be
challenging since both are very different races. I learned that I prefer
training for a race like The Rut more than Cuyamaca. Like that T-shirt I saw
Gary Robbins in, if I had a choice I'd "choose vert".


## Plan
 
I had 3 goals going into Cuyamaca. 

1. Earn 4 UTMB points. Need to: just finish. 
1. Earn a Western States lottery ticket. Need to: finish under 17 hours.
1. Beat my Ultrasignup predicted time of 15:27. Need to: dial it in.
 
The first 2 goals weren't going to be a problem, just needed to not do
anything stupid. Goal #3 could challenge me.
 
Cuyamaca 100K consists of 3 distinct loops of roughly 32, 13, and 18 miles.
Each loop starts and ends at Camp Cuyamaca. The first loop is supposed to be
the most difficult since it includes a gradual, 5-ish mile climb up to
Cuyamaca Peak at 6500' near mile 23. For reference, the start is at 4000'. Not
a monster climb but a good chunk of the total elevation of the 100K. I knew
from Shane that the 3rd loop had runnable sections and I needed to save my
legs for the last 18 miles. The 2nd loop was a wildcard. Going into the race
my strategy was go real conservative for loop 1 (plan for 8 hours), go a
little easy on loop 2 (plan for 2.5-3 hours), crank it up a bit on loop 3
(plan for 4.5-5 hours). That would give me a finish time between 15-16 hours.


## Execution
 
On race day, after chatting with the only Oregonian at the race, Dave, and his
pacer, Matt, I decided to start in the back of the pack. The course literally
starts off with single-track for a few miles, meaning immediate bottleneck.
Starting in the back would prevent me from taking off too fast. I also planned
on power-walking the climb to Cuyamaca Peak, which I did. There's a short,
2-ish mile, rocky, moderately technical section immediately after Cuyamaca
Peak, descending down. Since technical, rocky downs are my kryptonite, I took
it real easy here too. After this section, I hit aid station #4 where a
volunteer told me to be sure to make the turn not more than 100 meters ahead
since a few runners ahead of me did miss it. Sure enough, Tim from Sacramento
and I, both missed it, adding maybe 10 minutes. Then near mile 29 I spooked
what I am pretty sure was a rattlesnake just off the trail. Didn't stop and
look back to confirm. Just played back the sound it made in my head and
wondered if I was lucky or are rattlesnakes not that aggressive. I came into
Camp Cuyamaca, finishing loop 1 in 7:16 and checked out at 7:22.
 
Since I had a big cushion I decided to take loop 2 real, real easy. I figured
if I could make it back to Camp Cuyamaca to finish loop 2 in 11 hours then I'd
still be in good shape to hit my goals. Doing the math in my head, I figured I
had 3.5 hours to go a bit less than 13 miles. That was such a luxurious
cushion I was okay with doing a lot of walking. I even got cocky enough to
have this conversation at the lone aid station on loop 2:
 
**Me:** What kind of beer is that?  
**Aid station volunteer:** Watermelon Dorado, it's good  
**Me:** Ew. I hate watermelon.  
**ASV:** Hold on, I got something for you. Hey, where's my bottle opener? I got to get something for Mr. Fussypants over there. Where's Mr. Fussypants?  
**Me:** Over here.  
**ASV:** How's this?  
**Me [takes a few swigs]:** Oh yeah. That's good.  
 
I ended up checking back into Camp Cuyamaca at 10:52, slightly ahead of
schedule but regretting the beer.
 
This was when I started to get slightly concerned. I had 6 hours to still get
a Western States lottery ticket, but motivation was waning and the sun was
coming down. After a short uphill section early in loop 3, I realized Shane
was right, there were some very runnable miles on loop 3. I ran some but knew
hitting goal #3 wasn't possible any longer and was expecting a 16:30 finish.
With the good cushion and the beginning of shin splints, I decided to power-walk
it in. This was about where I turned off my Suunto, at the 12-hour mark.
I didn't want to drain the battery completely since I still needed to track
the clock. Once I finished the candy part of the lollipop of loop 3, I saw the
sign telling runners it's only 1 mile to the finish. The time was surprisingly
15:48. If I pushed it, maybe I could sub-16? I didn't feel like pushing it and
finished at 16:04:38.


## Aftermath
 
To sum up, my race went almost as planned. Hit the main goals easily. Missed
the stretch goal by 37 minutes. Translation: stretch goal was a stretch.
 
I fueled on course entirely on Tailwind. I ate real food, including a bacon
quesadilla, at the aid stations. The aid stations and volunteers were amazing.
They definitely had it dialed in.

I feel like I have my gear dialed in. The La Sportiva Akashas felt great on my
feet the whole time. The Ultraspire Revolution vest did what it needed to do.
And the Petzl Tikka RXP headlamp was great.
 
4 days later, I'm still feeling those shin splints. It's actually a bit
painful to walk. Cuyamaca was the last race of the year. Was toying with one
more. But I'm going to have to heal up for a few weeks.


## Splits

Amazingly enough, all the walking didn't hurt my placement much. After
Cuyamaca Peak, I hovered in the high 80s, low 90s.
