## Pre-race

JFK wasn't a race that made the list when I made my 2014 race calendar.
By mid-September, I found out that we would likely be making a trip out to the DC/Baltimore area for family circumstances.
As with any travel plans, regardless of reason, I always check if there's a race that's logistically easy to do.
JFK has been on my bucket list for years, and they still weren't sold out.
Since they don't use Ultrasignup or some other online entry, I had to mull it over for a few days while I had to find an envelope and stamp for the entry form.

At first I was stoked to be able to do a race I've been wanting to do.
And for the first few weeks after I mailed in the entry form, I had a plan.
However, by late October, that plan went out the window due to a combination of work and personal obligations.
I missed my last long run before tapering.
And then the not-so-long run the week after that.
Then, instead of trying to compensate with three weeks to go, I pretty much gave up.

There was almost zero running in those three weeks (only 28 miles).
And I was eating a lot of stuff I really shouldn't have been eating (or shouldn't ever eat).
My sleep schedule was thrown off too.
Not ideal before a 50-miler, but I wasn't in panic or stressed out.
Also, I wasn't taking the course all that seriously.

My nonchalant attitude continued through to the day before race day.
I had a plan to fuel the first 20 miles with Trail Butter.
But with the sub-freezing tempatures predicted at start time, I planned on spreading the TB on tortillas so I wouldn't have frozen TB stuck inside the 4 oz pouch.
I couldn't find a grocery store on my way back from packet pickup.
And instead of going out again once I was told a grocery store was only a few miles away, I just bagged to plan and decided I'd eat whatever was at the aid stations.

I told Sean M. my race plan, before I lost my initial enthusiasm.

> Thanks! This course makes it interesting to plan out.
> I'm probably going to take it real easy on the AT and hopefully have enough gas in the tank to be more aggressive on the C&O.

Here's how it worked out.

I arrived to Boonsboro HS about one hour before the start.
I picked up my packet the night before, so all I needed to do was to sit around, finish getting dressed, listen to announcements and instructions from the RD, and wait.
I dumped a clean set of warm clothes in my backpack and dropped it off to the truck that was going to take it to the finish.
With 15 minutes until start, the crowd started making the one kilometer walk to the starting line in downtown Boonsboro.


## Section 1

The 2.5 miles of road before hitting the Appalachian Trail was a nice warmup.
Once on the AT, I was surprised that the early sections of the AT were paved.
I expected dirt and rocks.
The highest point on the JFK course is at about 1700' at mile 5.5.
Going in, I expected this to be the first of three big challenges for me on this course.
My initial plan was to walk it, but I felt so good early on, that I slow jogged it.
Strava tells me I took mile 5 in 12:28 and mile 6 in 13:44.
The rest of the AT after the hill was mostly downhill, except for a short climb at mile 10.

The second big challenge I thought of going in to the race was navigating the rocks on the AT.
I actually felt pretty comfortable for almost all of the AT section of JFK.
Even though I don't do a lot of running in the Gorge, I've done enough to be comfortable on the AT.
Plus, I've seen enough rocks in Squamish and Volcanic, the two races I've run prior to JFK.
So two big challenges down, one more to go.

The last big challenge I had going in to the race was the long steep switchback at the end of the AT section.
This comes at about mile 16.
I've heard this is the part where people easily fall and hurt themselves.
Again, my plan was to really take it easy, walk if necessary.
And again, I was feeling good enough and confident in my foot placement to take it a notch above taking it easy.

So I came out of the AT feeling really good, with the big challenges of this course behind me.
I came into the aid station right after the AT at about 3:05 (with 14 aid stations, I forget which AS this one was).
Next up, the flat marathon, 26 miles, on the C&O towpath.


## Section 2

Even with a 5-hour marathon, which I thought was generous, I thought I had a near-lock on a sub-10 hour time.

Not much to say about the C&O marathon.
It was boring.
So boring that I almost fell asleep a couple of time.
Really.
Multiple times, I thought to myself, "I really miss the AT; I could run that all day".
There wasn't even much to look at.
No wildlife in the Potomac.
No boats.
No change of scenary.
No interesting buildings.
The aid stations along the C&O seemed to be near towns, but at the edge of these towns.
I had to use a port-o-potty at the aid station around mile 31.
Someone threw-up in one of the two port-o-potties, so I opted not to use the barfy one and that stop took a little longer than it should have.
That was interesting.
I started cramping a little around miles 33-36.
That was interesting.
When my Suunto Ambit2 R said I had gone 35.5 miles when I rolled into the aid station at mile 34, I panicked a little because I saw my sub-10 hour time getting less likely.
That was interesting.
When I rolled into the aid station at mile 42, I was so done with the C&O.
It didn't even bother me that I missed the 3 pm cutoff to avoid wearing the required safety vest.
I finished the C&O marathon in a little over 5 hours, at the 8:16 mark.

On the plus side, I did hit the 50K mark at 6:03 and reckoned I easily beat the 50-mile finisher.
It's always my goal when I do a 50-miler to beat the 1st finisher's time with my 50K time.
Unfortunately, I would find out later, I had the men's record time confused with the women's record time.
The 1st place 50 mile finisher, Jim Walmsley, came in at 5:56:31.


## Section 3

So now, the final 9 miles on country roads to the finish.
Not a whole lot to say about this section either.
It was more interesting than the C&O.
Some rollers to run, requiring different muscles.
Some houses, horses, cows, birds, and dead skunks to look at.
I wanted to go easy, now that sub-10 was out the window, but I still wanted to make sure I had enough to make a charge at the end.
Now, the goal was to take the last 5K with a 5K race mentality.
That lasted for most of the last 5K; I was passing a lot a people, but ran out of gas in the last half mile.
I ended up cruising that last half mile and came into the finish at 10:23:27.
