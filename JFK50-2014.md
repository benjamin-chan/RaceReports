JFK wasn't a race that made the list when I made my 2014 race calendar.
By mid-September, I found out that we would likely be making a trip out to the DC/Baltimore area for family circumstances.
As with any travel plans, regardless of reason, I always check if there's a race that's logistically easy to do.
JFK has been on my bucket list for years, and they still weren't sold out.
Since they don't use Ultrasignup or some other online entry, I had to mull it over for a few days while I had to find an envelope and stamp for the entry form.

At first I was stoked to be able to do a race I've been wanting to do.
And for the first few weeks after I mailed in the entry form, I had a plan.
However, by late October, that plan went out the window due to a combination of work and personal obligations.
I missed my last long run before tapering.
And then the not-so-long run the week after that.
Then, instead of trying to compensate with three weeks to go, I pretty much gave up.

There was almost zero running in those three weeks (only 28 miles).
And I was eating a lot of stuff I really shouldn't have been eating (or shouldn't ever eat).
My sleep schedule was thrown off too.
Not ideal before a 50-miler, but I wasn't in panic or stressed out.
Also, I wasn't taking the course all that seriously.

My nonchalant attitude continued through to the day before race day.
I had a plan to fuel the first 20 miles with Trail Butter.
But with the sub-freezing tempatures predicted at start time, I planned on spreading the TB on tortillas so I wouldn't have frozen TB stuck inside the 4 oz pouch.
I couldn't find a grocery store on my way back from packet pickup.
And instead of going out again once I was told a grocery store was only a few miles away, I just bagged to plan and decided I'd eat whatever was at the aid stations.

I told Sean M. my race plan, before I lost my initial enthusiasm.

> Thanks! This course makes it interesting to plan out.
> I'm probably going to take it real easy on the AT and hopefully have enough gas in the tank to be more aggressive on the C&O.

Here's how it worked out.
