Ahh... Volcanic 50, the circumnavigation of Mount St. Helens.
Is it a 50K or a 50 mile? It's officially a 50K (well, a tad longer) but it beats you up like a 50 mile.
I went in with a B-goal of beating my course PR of 10:41 from 2013 and an A-goal of beating 10:00.
I wouldn't make either.

I was in good spirits, much better coming off of Squamish this year compared to last year's Squamish disaster.
I knew I had to start off slow and save some energy for the later half.
The larger field of runners this year helped to hold me back in the early stages.

I arrived at AS1 at 1:55-ish, pretty much the same time as last year.
I left feeling pretty good and optimistic that I could hit my B-goal.

I arrived at AS2 at about 3:30, again, almost the same exact time as last year.
When I got in, though, I realized that I hadn't been paying attention to my nutrition.
So I made sure to eat at the aid station.
The problem was nothing laid out on the table looked appetizing.
That usually doesn't happen.
Being able to eat at aid stations is never a problem for me; the problem is me not leaving the aid station because all I want to do is eat.
But I forced a variety of the usual ultra faire down my gullet, even Gu Brew, knowing I needed calories.
Then I grabbed a few things for the road, thanked the volunteers, and took off for the long 8-mile stretch to the next AS; probably the toughest stretch of the race.

The stretch from AS2 to AS3 was when things really started to unravel for me.
I still didn't want to eat anything.
I tried to force some Trail Butter down.
I love that stuff.
But it just didn't want to go down.
I thought about the Gu I grabbed at AS2.
Nope, didn't want it.
I finally tried some crystallized ginger, thinking it might settle my stomach and kick-start an appetite.
Still nothing.
So I rolled into AS3 at around 6:35, about 15 minutes slower than last year.
I didn't have my times from last year memorized, so at this point, I still thought my B-goal was within reach.
But I had to eat.
Luckily, AS3 had food, which in years past, wasn't the case.
I load up on everything, chips, PB&J, M&Ms, Gu, Gu Brew, fig newtons, and took some for the road.

I knew there was a fairly flat, runnable section between AS3 and AS4 so I made sure to conserve what little energy I had for that.
I didn't want to walk this section.
I actually felt reasonably good considering I knew I was running up a big calorie deficit.
When I run low on calories, I get light-headed.
I made a calculated decision to deal with that consequence instead of the risk of getting nauseous by forcing down food.
Probably not the best decision, but I knew I could keep moving, albeit slowly, if I was light-headed.
I might not have been able to keep moving if nauseous.
The only worry about my decision was navigating the boulder field at mile 30, but I figured I'll deal with it when I get there.
Oh, and I was able to slow jog that flat stretch; one small fleck of gold on an otherwise brutal day.

I rolled into AS4 at 8:15, right about when I expected to when I left AS3.
So another small victory.
Eight miles left, some runnable sections, plus the last two of those on runnable downhill, but the boulder field to cross.
I was still thinking I could hit my B-goal or come close.
Certainly sub-11 or a smidge over 11 was within reach.
I made sure to take in some calories at AS4 since I knew I wouldn't be eating anything after I left.
I also downed some Coke, wiped the sweat off my face with a baby-wipe, thanked the volunteers, and took off the final stretch.

Oh... that Coke.
Bad idea.
At the time, I thought the caffeine and calories would be great since it worked for me at Squamish.
But my stomach didn't like it.
Runnable sections became walking sections.
Sub-12 became the new goal.
I knew I wasn't going to DFL since I passed a guy in such bad shape the medical helicopter dropped down to check on him (then I thought if that guy DNF'ed, I could still DFL... d'oh! Or yay!).
After the boulder field, I got passed by the guy who was cursing very loudly at the boulders ("... lame-ass bitch... I want off of these fucking rocks..."), passed by some bow hunters, then walked the very runnable downhill to the finish.

Normally, when I finish, I'm starving.
This time, I still had no appetite.
Nothing sounded good.
Very weird day for me.
Actually, I'm amazed that I still finished within the cutoffs and didn't die or get hurt.
No exaggeration.
There were multiple times when I thought I really shouldn't be doing this in the state I'm in.
Two days after, I'm leaning towards not doing Volcanic again next year.
But that's pretty much how I felt the two other times and I still signed up to do it again.
It's a great race and definitely should be on everyone's bucket list.
I'm just thinking 3 buckets worth might just be enough.
