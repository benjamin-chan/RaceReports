Ahh... Volcanic 50, the circumnavigation of Mount St. Helens. Is it a 50K or a 50 mile? It's officially a 50K (well, a tad longer) but it beats you up like a 50 mile. I went in with a B-goal of beating my course PR of 10:41 from 2013 and an A-goal of beating 10:00. I wouldn't make either.

I was in good spirits, much better coming off of Squamish this year compared to last year's Squamish disaster. I knew I had to start off slow and save some energy for the later half. The larger field of runners this year helped to hold me back in the early stages.

I arrived at AS1 at 1:55-ish, pretty much the same time as last year. I left feeling pretty good and optimistic that I could hit my B-goal.

I arrived at AS2 at about 3:30, again, almost the same exact time as last year. When I got in, though, I realized that I hadn't been paying attention to my nutrition. So I made sure to eat at the aid station. The problem was nothing laid out on the table looked appetizing. That usually doesn't happen. Being able to eat at aid stations is never a problem for me; the problem is me not leaving the aid station because all I want to do is eat. But I forced a variety of the usual ultra faire down my gullet, even Gu Brew, knowing I needed calories. Then I grabbed a few things for the road, thanked the volunteers, and took off for the long 8-mile stretch to the next AS; probably the toughest stretch of the race.

The stretch from AS2 to AS3 was when things really started to unravel for me. I still didn't want to eat anything. I tried to force some Trail Butter down. I love that stuff. But it just didn't want to go down. I thought about the Gu I grabbed at AS2. Nope, didn't want it. I finally tried some crystallized ginger, thinking it might settle my stomach and kick-start an appetite. Still nothing. So I rolled into AS3 at around 6:35, about 15 minutes slower than last year. I didn't have my times from last year memorized, so at this point, I still thought my B-goal was within reach. But I had to eat. Luckily, AS3 had food, which in years past, wasn't the case. I load up on everything, chips, PB&J, M&Ms, Gu, Gu Brew, fig newtons, and took some for the road.
