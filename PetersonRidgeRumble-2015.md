Rumble #8 in the books.
Returned to the 40 after a couple years doing the 20.
Goal was to finish the race with enough gas in the tank for 10 more miles.
So, ran conservatively.
Time goal was a modest sub-8 hours.
Felt great most of the time.
Had a bit of stomach issues and slight cramping, but walking it off helped.
Spent too much time lollygagging at the aid stations.
Did a better job of taking in calories, but could have been better with hydration.
Never felt dehydrated, though.

Official time: 7:39:38
